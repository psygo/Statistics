# Overview

- This is a repo with the intention of studying and applying basic statistics to the [Google Play](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [Wine](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/home) Kaggle Datasets.
- The main code files are `study_google` and `study_wines.py`.
- There is also a `Statistics.xmind` Mind Map file, which could be useful for studying statistics.
- And, if you want to check out my full course notes, open the `Statistics Notebook.pdf` and `statistics.md` files.
